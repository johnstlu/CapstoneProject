# CapstoneProject

This repository contains the Python code and simulations used in my undergraduate thesis, which focuses on quantum mechanical systems. The project implements various quantum simulations using object-oriented programming (OOP) and is organized to demonstrate key concepts in computational physics.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- **main_system/**: Contains the primary class that models and simulates the quantum mechanical system. This class includes methods for system construction, simulation, and visualization.
  - `quantum_system.py`: Main OOP class for the simulation.
  
- **other_systems/**: Houses code for alternative or work-in-progress simulations that are based on variations of the primary system.
  - `alt_quantum_system.py`: Simulations of an alternative quantum system.

- **snippets/**: Includes smaller code snippets or scripts for testing, plotting, or experimenting with various methods used in the project.
  - `test_spin_chain.py`: A test script for simulating a spin chain system.
  - `plot_energy_levels.py`: A script to plot the energy spectrum of the quantum system.

- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python packages required to run the code.

## Installation

To run the code locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CapstoneProject.git
cd CapstoneProject
pip install -r requirements.txt
